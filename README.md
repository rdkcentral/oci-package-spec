# OCI Package Specification

This repository contains the OCI Package Specification, which defines a standard for packaging applications, runtimes, and other resources as OCI (Open Container Initiative) artifacts. This specification is designed to provide a clear and consistent way to bundle and distribute software components.

## Specification Documents

*   **[Package Format Specification (format.md)](format.md):** This document describes the structure of an OCI package, including the different layers and their corresponding media types. It details how to bundle package payloads and metadata into a single OCI artifact.

*   **[Package Metadata Specification (metadata.md)](metadata.md):** This document defines the metadata that can be included in a package. This metadata provides essential information about the package, such as its name, version, dependencies, and required permissions.

*   **[Package Metadata JSON Schema (package.schema.json)](schema/package.schema.json):** This file provides a JSON schema for validating the package metadata.
